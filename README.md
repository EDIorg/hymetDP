# hymetDP
## Overview
Tools to create, use, and convert ‘hymetDP’ datasets. ‘hymetDP’ is a dataset design pattern for harmonizing hydrological and meteorological data in a research question agnostic format, from source datasets published across multiple repositories, and with methods that keep the derived datasets up-to-date as the underlying sources change.

Based off of the [ecocomDP](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP) R package.
