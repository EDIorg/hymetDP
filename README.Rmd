## Overview

Tools to create, use, and convert 'ecocomDP' datasets. 'ecocomDP' is a dataset design pattern for harmonizing ecological community surveys in a research question agnostic format, from source datasets published across multiple repositories, and with methods that keep the derived datasets up-to-date as the underlying sources change. Described in O'Brien et al. (2021), <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101374>.
